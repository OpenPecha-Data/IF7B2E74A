What is action (karman)? It is the action that is intention (cetanā) and the action after having intended (cetayitvā). [That is] the condensed definition of action.Moreover, action is also of five kinds: the action that is perception (upalabdhikarman), the action that is efficacy (kāritrakarman), the action that is determination (vyavasāyakarman), the action that is transformation (pariṇatikarman) and the action that is obtainment (prāptikarman).In this context, however, the action that is determination is meant mainly.
What is the action of intention (cetanākarman)? It is an action of the mind that is a thought impulse (cittābhisaṃskāra). It is meritorious, demeritorious, or [leading to] immovability.What is the "action after having intended"? It is bodily, verbal and mental action.Moreover, those actions of body, speech and mind are [either] wholesome (kuśala) or unwholesome (akuśala).Unwholesome [actions] are the ten unwholesome paths of action (karmapatha), namely: killing, taking what has not been given, sexual misconduct, lying, slander, harsh words, idle prattle, covetousness, harmful intent and wrong view.Wholesome are the ten wholesome paths of action, namely, abstaining from killing [etc.,] up to abstaining from idle prattle, as well as absence of covetousness, absence of harmful intent and right view.The characteristics of killing and so on are also to be understood from [the viewpoints of] object (vastu), disposition (āśaya), preparation (prayoga), defilement (kleśa) and completion (niṣṭhāgamana).[In the sūtras] "intentional action" has been mentioned. What is [that] intentionality (saṃcetanīyatā)?
It is (1.) intentionality [due to] the command of others, (2.) intentionality [due to] the persuasion of others, (3.) intentionality without having understood, (4.) intentionality [due to] intense fixation [because of] the roots [of the unwholesome actions] and (5.) intentionality [due to] a mistake.Here, [when] the karman of intentionality due to intense fixation on the roots and the karman of intentionality due to a mistake are done and heaped up, their ripening is not [something that is] not to be experienced [as a future unpleasant result].The performing of actions is doing [them]. Heaping up is the increase of the imprints.As for what has been said [in the sūtra] "karman that is certainly to be experienced": What is [that] "certainty"?
[It is] (1.) the certainty of doing the action, (2.) the certainty of experiencing the ripening and (3.) the certainty of time.
The fruit of ripening of the ten unwholesome paths of action [is to be experienced] in the bad destinies.The concordant fruit is that the body and the possessions [of those being reborn] among men are wretched, each one of them in a way that corresponds [to the respective bad action performed].The sovereign fruit is that external objects are wretched, one by one, according to [the respective original action].As it is [said] in the sūtra,The fruit of ripening of the ten wholesome paths of action [is to be experienced] among gods or humans.The concordant fruit is that body and possessions [of those being reborn] in exactly those [good destinies] are excellent, one by one, according to [the respective original action].The sovereign fruit is that the external objects [of those being reborn] in exactly those [good destinies] are excellent, one by one, according to [the respective original action].It is to be understood that wholesome and unwholesome karman has the function (karman) of entailing and fulfilling rebirth in a good or bad destiny."Entailing" is [the function] through which [karman] entails ripening.Fulfilling is [the function] through which, once one is reborn, one experiences what is wanted or unwanted.
There is [the case that] action entails a single existence through a single action. There is [also the case that] action entails many existences through a single action. There is [also the case that] action entails a single existence through many actions. There is [also the case that] action entails many existences through one action.How does a living being that is furnished with many karmas experience the fruit of [their] ripening successively?Here, what is most heavy ripens first, or, what has become manifest at the time of death, or that which has been [frequently] cultivated, or what has been done first will ripen as the very first.[As for] what is said [in the sūtra]:"meritorious, demeritorious and immovable action".What is meritorious? That which is wholesome, connected with the [realm of] desire.What is demeritorious? That which is unwholesome.What is the immovable action? That which is wholesome, connected with the [both] the material and immaterial realms.It has been said [in the sūtra]: "ignorance is the condition of the impulses (saṃskārāḥ); [they are] meritorious, demeritorious and immovable."How do meritorious, demeritorious and immovable impulses come about with ignorance as [their] condition?
There are two kinds of bewilderment. Bewilderment with regard to the ripening of the fruit and bewilderment with regard to true reality.For someone who is bewildered with regard to the ripening of the fruit, demeritorious impulses come about. For someone who is bewildered with regard to true reality, meritorious and immovable [impulses come about].
The preparation for killing [comes about] through greed, hatred and delusion, its accomplishment through hatred. [The preparation for] harsh speech and harmful intent is exactly like that of killing.The preparation for taking what has not been given [comes about] through greed, hatred and delusion, its accomplishment through greed. [The preparation and accomplishment of] sexual misconduct and covetousness is exactly like that of taking what has not been given.The preparation for lying [comes about] through greed, hatred and delusion, its accomplishment through any of the three. [The preparation for] idle prattle and slander is exactly like that of lying.The preparation for wrong view [comes about] through greed, hatred and delusion, its accomplishment through delusion.
"Common karman" has been mentioned [in the sūtra], also "individual karman", as well as "strong karman" and "weak karman".What is common karman? It is that which differentiates the receptacle world.What is individual karman? It is that which differentiates the world of beings.And there is also a [kind of] karman which consists in the mutual influence of beings, on the basis of which it is said that beings influence [one another] mutually. Because that being is not easily found who would not be delighted (upabhoga) by looking at one another with another being and so on.What is strong karman? Any intentional unwholesome karman [the result of which] is to be experienced in the hells [and which belongs to] a person in whom the antidote is strong, is [then] to be experienced in this life because the antidote gains strength. And [the result of unwholesome karman] which is to be experienced in this life is not to be experienced [at all].Therefore, [in the case of such a person] the karman of the antidote and [also] all intentional wholesome karman, [are] strong.Thinking of this, the Sublime One said "[As for] the karman which has been done to a limited [extent] by the Noble Hearer, whose mind is well-cultivated, limitless and vast: he is not lead by that [karman], it does not stay with him, he will not be counted [as belonging to a specific destination] through it.""Moreover the intentional unwholesome karman of a person in whom the antidote is weak and [his] intentional karman which will certainly ripen – [provided that it] has not been given up and has not been completely understood–that (i.e. those two kinds of karman) is strong. That is intended [by the Sublime One] here."Moreover [four are] strong by nature: unwholesome [karman] that is connected with the desire realm; and also what has been done habitually before; [the karman that has been done when] standing on [one’s] feet; and also [the karman] that cannot be cured, belonging to those who are [and will be] without complete nirvana.Karman can be understood as being strong also from [the point of view of its] field as well as from [the point of view of its] thought impulse.Moreover, karman can also be understood as strong in terms of nine aspects. From [the point of view of its] field, object, nature, basis, attention, disposition, companion, frequent performance and connection with many people.Weak karman is [to be understood] as the opposite of that.The Sublime One said: "If someone were to assert: ’In whichever way this person has done and heaped up karman, in [exactly] that way will he experience [its] ripening,’ then one would not live the life of an ascetic (brahmacarya), and no occasion would be known for the right extinction of suffering, for bringing an end to suffering".
"But if someone were to assert: ’If a person has done and heaped up karman to be experienced in such and such a way, he will experience [its] ripening to be experienced in such and such a way’, then one would live the life of an ascetic, and an occasion would be known for the right extinction of suffering, for bringing an end to suffering."Here, the Bhagavat has rejected [the view that] karman associated with pleasure has a ripening which is [equally] associated with pleasure.Likewise [the view that karman] associated with suffering, has [a ripening that is equally] associated with suffering. And [the view that karman] that is associated with neither suffering nor pleasure [has a ripening] that is associated with neither suffering nor pleasure [are equally rejected].[The Sublime One] has however admitted that [karman] associated with pleasure that is to be experienced as pleasure has a pleasant ripening,that [this kind of karman associated with pleasure, if it is] to be experienced as suffering, has a [ripening as] suffering,and that [this kind of karman associated with pleasure, if it is] to be experienced as neither suffering nor pleasure, has neither [its ripening as] suffering nor pleasure.[The Sublime One has likewise] admitted that [karman] that is associated with suffering, if it is to be experienced as pleasure, has a pleasurable ripening.that [this kind of karman associated with suffering if it is] to be experienced as suffering has [a ripening] as suffering,that [this kind of karman associated with suffering, if it is] to be experienced as neither suffering nor pleasure, has [a ripening that is] neither suffering nor pleasure,[and] that [the karman] that is associated with neither suffering nor pleasure to be experienced as pleasure has [a ripening as] pleasure [is] admitted [by the Sublime One].[That this karman associated with neither suffering nor pleasure, if it is] to be experienced as suffering, has [a ripening as] suffering,that [this karman associated with neither suffering nor pleasure if it is] to be experienced as neither suffering nor pleasure, has [a ripening as] neither suffering nor pleasure,that is what is intended here [by the Sublime One].The classification of karman is (a.) karman that is restraint, (b.) karman that is non-restraint, (c.) karman that is neither restraint, nor non-restraint.What is the karman that is restraint? It is (a.) condensed in the prātimokṣa restraints, (b.) condensed in the restraints of absorption and (c.) condensed in the restraints without inflow.What is the karman condensed in the prātimokṣa restraints? There are eight kinds: (1.) the restraints of a fully ordained monk, (2.) the restraints of a fully ordained nun, (3.) the restraints of a trainee nun, (4.) the restraints of a novice monk, (5.) the restraints of a novice nun, (6.) the restraints of a male lay follower, (7.) the restraints of a female lay follower, 8.) the fasting restraints.
With regard to what kind of person has the restraint of the renunciate been established? [With regard to someone] whose conduct is [characterized by] keeping aloof from bad conduct and whose conduct is [likewise characterized by] keeping aloof from sensual pleasure.With regard to what kind of person has the restraint of the male or female lay follower been established? [With regard to someone whose] conduct is [characterized by] keeping aloof from bad conduct, but whose conduct is not separated from sensual pleasure.With regard to what kind of person is the fasting restraint established? [With regard to someone whose] conduct is neither [characterized by] keeping aloof from bad conduct, nor from sensual pleasure.One who trains in [only] one part of the basic points of training of a layman, should he be called "possessed of the restraint of a layman", or should he be called not "possessed of [it]?"He is to be called possessed of [the restraint]. But he should also be called one who has bad discipline.Is the restraint of a layman prohibited for asexuals and eunuchs, or not? The restraint of a layman is not prohibited [for them]. But the state of a layman is prohibited. Because they are not proper to wait upon both monks and nuns.There are five [kinds of] eunuchs: 1. eunuch by birth, 2. jealous eunuch, 3. moon phase eunuch, 4. inject eunuch, 5. eunuch through accident.What is the restraint of absorption? It is the abandoning [on the part] of [a person who] has become free from passion towards the objects of desire at the time the seeds [of] the defilements that arouse corrupt discipline are damaged (upaghāta).[It is, moreover,] the abandoning [of corrupt discipline on the part] of [a person] who has become free from passion towards the first level of absorption, of [a person] who has become free from passion towards the second level of absorption, [and] of [a person] who has become free from passion towards the third level of absorption.[Addition by XUANZANG: "Those are the bodily and vocal karman that are included in what is called the restraint of absorption."]What is the restraint without inflow? It is the abandoning–by means of attention without inflow–[on the part] of [a person who] has seen the [Four] Truths.What is non-restraint? The decision, taken either because of being born into [such a group] or because of [deliberately] taking up their occupation, of [persons in] non-restraint, i.e. shepherds, poulterers, pig breeders, bird hunters, fishermen, deer hunters, rabbit hunters, thieves, executioners, elephant tamers, snake charmers, prison guards, spies, or torturers, to commit the actions that are [the occupations] of these [groups].What is neither restraint nor non-restraint? It is the either wholesome or unwholesome karman of a person who is neither subject to restraint nor to non-restraint.[Explanation by XUANZANG: "Moreover [as for] the division of karman, there are three kinds, namely: the karman that is to be experienced as pleasure (sukha), the karman that is to be experienced as suffering (duḥkha) and the karman that is to be experienced as neither pleasure nor suffering."]What is the karman that is to be experienced as pleasant? It is the wholesome [karman] of the desire realm and the [first] three dhyānas.What is the karman that is to be experienced as unpleasant? It is the unwholesome [karman].What is the karman that is to be experienced neither as suffering nor as joy? It is the wholesome [karman] above the third dhyāna.[Explanation by XUANZANG: "Moreover [as for] the division of karman, there are three kinds, namely: the karman that is to be experienced in this lifetime, the karman that is to be experienced after rebirth, the karman that is to be experienced later."]
What is the karman to be experienced in this lifetime? It is that, the ripening of which ripens in this lifetime, namely, that [karman] which comes from doing damage or benefit to someone who has arisen from the concentration of benevolence.As [in the case of deeds which one performs in order to do harm or benefit to someone arisen] from the concentration of benevolence, and likewise to one arisen from the concentration without defilements, from the meditative attainment of cessation, from the fruit of a stream enterer, [or] from the fruit of an Arhat, and to the monastic community headed by the Buddha. Or, whatever wholesome or wholesome [deeds] which one performs with a perception [accompanied by] a particularly strong motivation (āśaya). [All those lead to results to be experienced in this lifetime.]What is the karman that is to be experienced after rebirth? It is that, the ripening of which ripens in the very next lifetime. For example, the karman that consists in the five actions [that bring] immediate [retribution]. Or, again, other [kinds of] wholesome and unwholesome [karman].What is the karman to be experienced in another lifetime? That, the ripening of which ripens in a lifetime later than that [following lifetime].[Explanation by XUANZANG: "Moreover [as for] the division of karman, there are four kinds, namely: black karman with black ripening, white karman with white ripening, black and white karman with black and white ripening. Not black [and] white karman without ripening which extinguishes all karmas.]
What is black karman with black ripening? That which is unwholesome.What is white karman with white ripening? The wholesome [karman] of the three realms.What is white and black [karman] with white and black ripening? That which is connected with [the realm of] desire [and] mixed. [It is] either black from [the point of view of its] disposition and white from [the point of view of its] preparation, or black from [the point of view of its] preparation and white from [the point of view of its] disposition.What is not black but white karman without ripening [that] is conducive to the extinction of karman? It is the karman without inflow on the paths of preparation and immediacy.[Addition by XUANZANG, corresponds to ASBh text below.]What is the action of giving? It is to be understood through [its] cause, motivation, basis, and also [its] nature.Its cause is non-greed, non-hatred and non-delusion.[Its] motivation is the intention that is accompanied by those.[Its] basis is the object to be given.[Its] nature is the action of body and speech when one gives [the object] away.How is the perfection of giving [to be understood]? As constant giving, impartial giving and giving that completely fulfils the wishes.Giving should also be understood to be perfect in so far as it is unattached giving, extensive giving, giving with joy, frequent giving, giving to [an appropriate] vessel and giving by way of correctly distributing [the gifts] to one’s kin and strangers.How is the perfection of the gift to be understood? The [gift is perfect] because the object to be given [has not been acquired through] misappropriation (/embezzlement), the object to be given [has not been acquired through] robbing it from others, that the object to be given is not stinking and free from dirt, that the object to be given is appropriate, the object to be given has been procured in accordance with the Dharma.[Sūtra quotation, added by XUANZANG: "As the sūtra says: He is furnished with discipline. He holds the Prātimokṣa restraints well. His manners and the places he goes are all of integrity. When he sees a tiny sin, great dread arises. In all the subjects of training, he takes [upon himself] the training well."]
How is he someone who has discipline? Because [he] keeps the discipline he has taken up.How is [he] restrained by the Prātimokṣa restraint? Because he has the discipline that is conducive to deliverance.How is he excellent in conduct and location? Because he has discipline without reproach.How does he perceive a danger in even the tiniest vices (avadyāḥ)? Because he has a discipline that is being trained with utmost earnestness.How does he train having taken up the bases of training? Because his discipline is one of training the training completely.
[Addition by XUANZANG, inserted from ASBh 71,20-21 (see below).]How is he restrained with body and speech? Because he is possessed of awareness.How is he excellent through excellence of body and speech? Because he does not commit offences.How is his conduct of body and speech purified? Because his conduct is based on concentration [obtained] through the successive steps starting with absence of regret.How is his conduct of body and speech wholesome? Because it is not mixed with defiled reflection.How is his conduct of body and speech blameless? Because he has given up the life of an ascetic celibacy out of aspiration [for worldly matters].How is his conduct of body and speech free from harm? Because he does not disparage others and because it is pleasant to stay with him.How is his conduct of body and speech conducive? Because it is favourable for attaining nirvāṇa.How is his conduct of body and speech appropriate? Because it does not exhibit his good [deeds] and conceal his bad [deeds].How is his conduct of body and speech suitable? Because his discipline is such that it attracts [his] fellow ascetics.How is the conduct of body and speech proper? Because he has destroyed conceit towards the masters and those representing the masters.How is his conduct of body and speech respectful (pradakṣiṇa)? Because he receives the instruction respectfully.How is his conduct of body and speech untormented? Because he has avoided all violent asceticism and adherence to what is miserable.How is his conduct of body and speech not to be regretted? Because he does not regret having abandoned his possessions and occupations.How is his conduct of body and speech without regret? Because [he] is without repentance [as he is] not satisfied with just a little [wholesome activity].The Sublime One said: "These beings have karman as their own, are heirs of their karman, have karman as their womb, resort to their karman. Karman divides beings into high and low, miserable and excellent."
How do they have karman as their own? Because they experience the ripening of the karman they have done themselves.How are they heirs of their karman? Because with regard to that experience of the ripening of what they themselves have done they are, [dividing] among themselves, heirs to wholesome or unwholesome karman.How do they have karman as their womb? Because beings arise from karman–which is [a principle] avoiding (varjita) [the wrong ideas of arising] without a cause or from an inadequate cause–as their womb.How do they resort to karman? Because they resort to the karman that is the antagonist [in order to achieve] liberation from the fetter of karman.What are high and low beings? Those who have attained existence in the good and bad destinies.What are miserable and excellent [beings]? The same [beings] as far as they are furnished with faults and those who are furnished with qualities.
It has been said [in the sūtras] "the ripening of karman for the beings is unthinkable". How is the ripening of karman thinkable? How is it unthinkable?That wholesome karman has a wanted ripening among gods and humans is thinkable.That unwholesome karman has an unwanted ripening in the miserable states, bad destinies, downfalls, [i.e. those of] hell beings, animals and hungry spirits is thinkable.[To think that] "by this [specific] karman the variety of bodies of beings comes about", this is [how] the [ripening of karman is] unthinkable.That same wholesome and unwholesome karman is unthinkable from the point of view of its location, object, cause and ripening.The karman that produces the various external phenomena is unthinkable.The karman (i.e. efficacy) that is connected with jewels, mantras, medicine and medical treatment (muṣṭiyoga) is unthinkable.All karman of the might of the Yogis is unthinkable.The karman of control of the Bodhisattvas is unthinkable. It is as follows:Because of control over [their] lifetime, control over [their] thought, control over utensils, control over karman, control over birth, control over aspiration (adhimukti), control over resolution (praṇidhāna), control over magical powers (ṛddhi), control over knowledge (jñāna), control over the Dharma.[Addition by XUANZANG, see ASBh 73,14, above]The karman of all the Buddhas to carry out the tasks of a Buddha is unthinkable.
